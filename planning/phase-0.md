# Phase 0: Project Setup & Planning

## Overview

This phase establishes the essential development environment by setting up version control and IDE configuration. Other setup tasks (project structure, dependencies, documentation) will be handled incrementally as we progress through subsequent phases.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Initialize Git Repository and Version Control

- [ ] Check if git repository is already initialized (`git status`)
- [ ] If not initialized, run `git init`
- [ ] Create initial commit with current project state
- [ ] Set up remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) if needed
- [ ] Configure git user settings if not already set globally
- [ ] Document git workflow (branch naming, commit conventions)

---

### 2. Set Up Cursor IDE Configuration

- [ ] Create `.cursor/` directory if needed for Cursor-specific settings
- [ ] Configure workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json` or Cursor equivalent)
  - TypeScript/JavaScript settings
  - Formatter preferences
  - Linter configuration
  - File associations
- [ ] Set up recommended extensions (if using `.vscode/extensions.json`)
- [ ] Configure debug configurations if applicable
- [ ] Document any Cursor-specific workflows or shortcuts

---

## Deliverables

- [ ] Initialized git repository with first commit
- [ ] Cursor IDE configuration files

---

## Success Criteria

- Git repository is properly initialized and configured
- Cursor IDE is configured for productive development
- Ready to begin Phase 1 development work

---

## Notes

- Other setup tasks (`.gitignore`, project structure, dependencies, README, etc.) will be handled as needed in subsequent phases
- This minimal approach allows us to start development quickly and add structure incrementally
